# Sidewalk-Detection-for-Autonomous-Navigation-Using-OpenCV
Python-based implementation for detecting sidewalks using OpenCV. It helps autonomous vehicles identify and follow sidewalks in real-time by processing camera feeds. The system detects sidewalk edges and plans navigation paths for safe movement, with future enhancements for obstacle avoidance and machine learning integration.
